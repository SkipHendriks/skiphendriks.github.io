Below is a collection of resources meant to help kick start your cryptocurreny adventure! This is by no means a comprehensive guide to becoming a pro, and some of the information may be contested, but hopefully you'll learn a few things to get you going. 

# Question 1: Why does this all matter anyway?

Without delving too deep in to the history of fiat currency and questionable monetary policies behind the world's biggest banking reserve, blockchain (the underlying concept behind Bitcoin) matters as it removes the centralisation and need for trust aspect of transfers of value.

Bitcoin, the first blockchain implementation by blockchain theorist Satoshi Nakamoto, was created with an hard limited supply of 21 million coins. These coins are distributed automatically as a reward for people "miners" who work to secure the network by processing transactions. We will not be going into the details of becoming a miner of the network as you first need a solid foundation of cryptocurrencies as a whole.

# Question 2: How do I make money from this?

With all new technologies and "bubbles", there is a lot of money to be made from volatile markets. Investing in start-ups through ICOs or just betting on which coin/token is going to become the new leader is capable of giving you 1000% returns, it for sure beats the 2% from your bank.

# Question 3: How does one become a crypto investor?

You'll need to have some tools in your arsenal, first of all you need a way to move your money from fiat currencies such as USD & GBP to crpytocurrenices. This is ironically the slowest part due to financial regulation, so make sure you get this going straight away and verfiy so you're not limited when the next market dip occurs!

Second, you'll want to move these to either an exchange for trading, or to a wallet to hold them securely long term.

# Question 4: Where can I learn more about the technical aspects?

Youtube is a great starting point as it provides a visual overview of the blockchain in action:

Once you've understood the above, you can move on to the idea of a programmable blockchain with coins such as Ethereum:

And eventually expand your understanding to competing designs of the blockchain such as the Tangle:

# Question 8: How to improve your market predictions?

One way to approach this is to apply techniques developed for the stock market, this is commonly referred to as "Technical Analysis" or "TA" for short. As much as this is backed by years of data modelling and research, you are playing with very volatile and unpredictable markets where a single bit of mis-interpreted news can cause a major panic sell among investors. Here are some good quality links to get you going:
